# RealEstateRegression
In today's  real estate market, accurately predicting property prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, and investors. With many factors influencing real estate values, from economic conditions to local infrastructure, the challenge lies in identifying and capitalizing on these factors that affect the market. This project aims to explore the potential of regression as a  tool to predict real estate prices. \\

Regression is a widely used method in predictive analytics, especially when the relationship between the dependent variable (property prices) and independent variables (factors influencing prices) is assumed to be linear. In this project, we will utilize property characteristics (such as size, age, and location) to build our model.
